                    <p> 2021, I started exploring career opportunities and took my interest
                        to delve into video game design and production where I currently study
                        at AIE (Academy of Interactive Entertainment) and am passionate about
                        understanding all aspects from scripting, level design and developing shaders
                        in game engines like Unity to building meshes, rigging and animating in Blender
                        and Maya.</p>

                <p>Alongside study, I also work part-time as a media designer for Systematiq, a
                    consulting firm in Melbourne working with both the marketing and eLearning teams
                    using a range of software including the Adobe and Microsoft office suites, primarily
                    focusing on creating video based content.</p>
