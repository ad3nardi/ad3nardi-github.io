                <p3> Using Unity protoypgin has allowed me to test a variety of mechanics and develop my C# and Unity skills
                    whilst implementing various ideas and concepts to a playable state.
                    One such is an RTS game which was developed to test the ability to develop touch controls on mobile whilst
                    testing the game on PC using the mouse. This was successful, whilst also allowing me to develop a more
                    dynamic real time combat system where ship direction was key to success given ships were given weapons
                    in specified positions of the unit, meaning not all weapons were able to be used at once given the ship
                    cannot fire through itself, with the indended purpose to be the greater emphasis on ship positioning and
                    forward planning for what would be an eventual opponent in the enemy AI.</p3>

                <p3> Each ship can be selected an moved, with each healthbar and label representing a different sub-system of
                    the ship which can be damaged to affect that unitâ€™s corresponding capabilities. I.e; damaing weapons
                    reduces damage output.</p3>
