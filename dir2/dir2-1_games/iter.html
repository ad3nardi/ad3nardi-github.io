                    <p3>Initial level designs for Iter were developed early using tools such as height maps (which would be used in
                        the project) and pro-builder built assets similar in shape to the planned art assets to get a better
                        understanding of gameplay flow, scale, cinematography and design for segments of the level so that
                        they could be better refined without having to worry about art assets. Below shows how these early
                        concepts were then developed into the actual game.
        
                        Level Layout
                        The original design (left) featured a straight isolated
                        path for the player to travel down, this felt too linear
                        and simple and was instead replaced for a more
                        dynamic area with bends and height variation so the
                        player could learn to slide and jump in the
                        introduction area whilst maintaining the idea of
                        following a path.
        
                        The original layout (left) saw the player introduced very early to intense platforming mechanics, using
                        water as purely a hazard. Further the level was severely drawn out and difficult to navigate and easy to
                        get lost in.
                        Compared to the 2nd design (right) this level is now whilst more linear, allows for exploration with a
                        clearer path where the river acts as a point of reference to the player. Further, it reduces the amount of
                        platforming, opting more for segments of sliding, which having been tweaked promotes more fun and
                        momentum to the game.
                        The second design itself has gone through several iterations where the red (1st) and blue (2nd) followed a
                        much longer path that when reviewed in the context of the whole game added very little to the playerâ€™s
                        experience and fluffed out the playtime without much reward. Thus, by cutting through using the simple
                        tree barriers already in the game, the level was shortened, and the art team has been able to better focus
                        on the environment in a shorter area. Further, more effort could be put toward revising and developing
                        the sliding sections to feel more momentous and cinematic for the player.
        
                        This level of Iter saw the player move
                        through a more desolate area, filled
                        with larger areas dedicated to ruins
                        and caves, with the intent to show
                        more environmental storytelling
                        through the use of ruin assets.
                        The original design (red) like the
                        previous level felt overly long and
                        extended whilst the new revision has
                        allowed for a more focussed route for
                        the benefit of the player and for
                        greater detail and effort to be put
                        into areas that matter more for the
                        player, whilst still allowing them to
                        explore other areas of the level such
                        as the ruin town (circular area).
                        It's changes like this which have seen
                        increases interest when testing and
                        more enthusiasm to continue given
                        the pacing feels more in line for the
                        game.
