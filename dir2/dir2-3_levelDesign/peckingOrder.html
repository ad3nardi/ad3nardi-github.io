                        This level was a result of a friendâ€™s prototype needing a quick level designed to accommodate their gang- beasts style bird arcade local multiplayer game where the aim was to hold the bread crumb (star) for the longest time possible whilst other players
                        would try to steal it from you via attacking or using power ups. This game came with the challenge of having no prior experience with the project and working with the specified hazards such as tram lines and power ups. Thus, my
                        intent was too keep the gameplay centralised for players given the camera was mostly static, and keeping power ups toward the corners allowed for a hit and run style level where the players could run to the corners for power ups
                        and fight in the centre over the bread crumbs. This level in a slight variation was the one decided to be used.
