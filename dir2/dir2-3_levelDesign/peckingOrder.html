                            This level was a result of a friendâ€™s
                            prototype needing a quick level
            
                            designed to accommodate their gang-
                            beasts style bird arcade local
            
                            multiplayer game where the aim was to
                            hold the bread crumb (star) for the
                            longest time possible whilst other
                            players would try to steal it from you via
                            attacking or using power ups.
                            This game came with the challenge of
                            having no prior experience with the
                            project and working with the specified
                            hazards such as tram lines and power
                            ups. Thus, my intent was too keep the
                            gameplay centralised for players given
                            the camera was mostly static, and
                            keeping power ups toward the corners
                            allowed for a hit and run style level
                            where the players could run to the
                            corners for power ups and fight in the
                            centre over the bread crumbs. This level
                            in a slight variation was the one decided
                            to be used.</p3>
