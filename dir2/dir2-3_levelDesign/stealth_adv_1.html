            <p3> Stealth Adventure Prototype:
                This prototype for a steal adventure
                game saw the development of a player
                controller and simple enemy AI that
                would patrol areas designated between
                nodes and hunt down the player when
                spotted, investigate the nearby area
                then engage the player with ranged
                weapons or return to their previous
                patrol route.
                The aim for the player was to make it
                inside the double story building (large
                top rectangular area) steal an item and
                make it to either yellow exit to
                complete the level. Ensuring challenge
                through timing guard patrols allowed
                keen eyed players the ability to time
                their movement to retain the stealth
                and take the item, whilst being able to
                fight back in melee to defeat enemies if
                that was the playerâ€™s desired approach,
                thus being able to cater for both
                playstyles was the challenge of the
                design.</p3>
