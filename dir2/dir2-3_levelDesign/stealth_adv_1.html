                <p> Stealth Adventure Prototype:
                    This prototype for a steal adventure
                    game saw the development of a player
                    controller and simple enemy AI that
                    would patrol areas designated between
                    nodes and hunt down the player when
                    spotted, investigate the nearby area
                    then engage the player with ranged
                    weapons or return to their previous
                    patrol route.
                    The aim for the player was to make it
                    inside the double story building (large
                    top rectangular area) steal an item and
                    make it to either yellow exit to
                    complete the level. Ensuring challenge
                    through timing guard patrols allowed
                    keen eyed players the ability to time
                    their movement to retain the stealth
                    and take the item, whilst being able to
                    fight back in melee to defeat enemies if
                    that was the playerâ€™s desired approach,
                    thus being able to cater for both
                    playstyles was the challenge of the
                    design.</p>
